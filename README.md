## Usage

After setting up your environment, you can start fine-tuning models and evaluating outputs. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how to use the scripts in this repository.

1. **Fine-Tuning a Model**:
   Use the provided scripts to fine-tune the Gemma 2B model on your dataset. Modify the configuration files as needed.

   ```bash
   python fine_tune.py --config config.yaml
   ```

2. **Evaluating Outputs**:
   Once you have fine-tuned your model, you can evaluate its performance using Opik. 

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model path/to/your/model
   ```

## Evaluation Tools

Evaluation is a critical step in the machine learning workflow. In this lab, you will use tools like Opik and LFM-40B to assess the performance of your models.

### Opik

Opik is designed to evaluate language model outputs. It provides various metrics to gauge the quality of generated text. Familiarize yourself with its features to make the most of your evaluations.

### LFM-40B

LFM-40B is another tool you can use for evaluating large language models. It offers a comprehensive suite of metrics to analyze model performance.

## Fine-Tuning Process

Fine-tuning a language model involves several steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect and preprocess your dataset.
2. **Configuration**: Set up your training parameters in the configuration file.
3. **Training**: Run the fine-tuning script.
4. **Evaluation**: Use the evaluation tools to assess the model's performance.

Each of these steps is crucial for achieving optimal results. Make sure to follow best practices during the fine-tuning process.
